# Overview
:idprefix:

This library implements a type-safe discriminated union (variant) type,
`variant<T...>`, that almost conforms to the {cpp}17 Standard's
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant[`std::variant<T...>`]. The
main differences between the two are:

* `variant<T...>` does not have a valueless-by-exception state;
* A converting constructor from, e.g. `variant<int, float>` to 
  `variant<float, double, int>` is provided as an extension;
* The reverse operation, going from `variant<float, double, int>` to
  `variant<int, float>` is provided as the member function `subset<U...>`.
  (This operation can throw if the current state of the variant cannot be
  represented.)
* `variant<T...>` is not trivial when all contained types are trivial, as
   mandated by {cpp}17.

To avoid the valueless-by-exception state, this implementation falls
back to using double storage unless

* one of the alternatives is the type `monostate`,
* one of the alternatives has a nonthrowing default constructor, or
* all the contained types are nothrow move constructible.

If the first two bullets don't hold, but the third does, the variant uses
single storage, but `emplace` constructs a temporary and moves it into place
if the construction of the object can throw. In case this is undesirable, one
can force `emplace` into always constructing in-place by adding `monostate` as
one of the alternatives.
